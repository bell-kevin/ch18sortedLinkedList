# ch18sortedLinkedList

Create a project that has a class for the linked list -- see the contents of NumberList.h right after Program 18-2 for a guide. 

![p](https://github.com/bell-kevin/ch18sortedLinkedList/blob/main/b740adea-2a65-4dd2-9f35-67b29560ee06.png)

Write an Add function that sorts the list as it adds -- see the contents of SortedNumberList.h just before Program 18-4.

Also include a function to display the list. 

Ask the user to insert integers until they enter a sentinel value. Display the list, and verify that it is in sorted order.

Here is an example:

Note that the numbers were entered in a random order, but the list is sorted. Take a screenshot of the result. Run the project again with different numbers, and different number of entries, and take a screenshot of the result.

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
